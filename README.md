# Custom-Terminal
A terminal with its own simple syntax and multiplatform

Currently the basic utilities of the command line are being created
but now it only works in Windows, but in the future it will complete 
all the functions and work under windows and linux unifying the 
commands of both systems.

In the "import" directory are all the external libraries that 
the code needs to work and all files related to each OS are  
in a folder with its name
